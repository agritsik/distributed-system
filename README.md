# distributed-system
Just another distributed system...

## Motivation
In order to demonstrate how to:
1. implement microservices
2. implement patterns for resilient distributed systems
3. use pub/sub and request/reply communication models
4. compare performance of different data storages

## Tooling:
1. Java and Spring Boot are used for implementing microservices 
2. RabbitMQ is used as a communication layer
3. Spring Cloud Netflix is used for implementing Service Discovery, Curcuit Breaker etc
4. Docker is used for containerization 
5. Mysql, MongoDB, Cassandra are used as a persistence level
