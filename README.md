# distributed-system
How to Build Resilient Distributed Systems

## Motivation

In order to demonstrate how to:

1. implement microservices
2. implement patterns for resilient distributed systems
3. use pub/sub and request/reply communication models
4. compare performance of different data storages


## Tooling:

The following techologies will be used:

1. Java and Spring Boot are used for implementing microservices 
2. RabbitMQ is used as a communication layer
3. Spring Cloud Netflix is used for implementing Service Discovery, Curcuit Breaker etc
4. Docker is used for containerization 
5. Mysql, MongoDB, Cassandra etc are used as a persistence level

## Testing/Monitoring/Logging

TBD
